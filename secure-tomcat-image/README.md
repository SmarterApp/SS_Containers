# Secure Tomcat Image
This docker image definition provides a secured Tomcat 7 Server with Java 7.  It is based off of the secured jre8 
Tomcat image work done by Eyal Dahari [here](https://github.com/eyaldahari/docker-secured-tomcat/blob/master/Dockerfile)

This image is designed to be used as a base when creating Tomcat servlet container images hosting WAR projects.
